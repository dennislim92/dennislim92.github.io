My name is Dennis Lim. I am a fifth year PhD economics candidate at the Singapore Management University , School of Economics. I will be on the job market from November 2023 onward. My area of research is in topics relating to high-dimensional statistics, particularly in weak identification of instrumental variables. I am also interested in treatment effects estimation, causal inference, synthetic controls, as well as conformal inference. Feel free to check out my research, or email me below for any questions
