My name is Dennis Lim, and I graduated with a Ph.D. in Economics from Singapore Management University in July 2024. My research focuses on both theoretical and applied econometrics, with particular attention to weak identification and high-dimensional issues. Additionally, I have interests in treatment effects, causal inference, synthetic control, and conformal inference. I plan to further explore and extend my research in these areas in the future. Feel free to check out my research, or email me if you have any questions.
